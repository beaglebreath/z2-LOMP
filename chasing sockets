okay the php.ini file was given another look over.

I deleted the copy at /overlay/etc/php.ini and began editing /etc/php.ini

these are the changes;
line 177 is not commented and is changed to mysqli.so
under the Module Settings section;
the block of settings which begins with [MySQL]
(lines 228 through 240) were copied and inserted immediately after line 240.
in the inserted block I changed all "mysql" to "mysqli"

like this;

[MySQLi]
mysqli.allow_local_infile = On
mysqli.allow_persistent = On
mysqli.cache_size = 2000
mysqli.max_persistent = -1
mysqli.max_links = -1
mysqli.default_port = 3306
mysqli.default_socket = /tmp/php.socket-0
mysqli.default_host = localhost
mysqli.default_user = ""
mysqli.default_password = ""
mysqli.connect_timeout = 60
mysqli.trace_mode = Off

the /tmp/php.socket-0 file is giving me grief.  the setting show is the 
first time i've had an error from a browser that reads;

Warning: mysqli_connect() [function.mysqli-connect]: (HY000/2013): Lost connection to MySQL server at 'reading initial communication packet', system error: 0 in /www/index.php on line 10


after rebooting, I ran 
mysqld &
  
150125 23:28:15 [Note] Event Scheduler: Loaded 0 events
150125 23:28:15 [Note] mysqld: ready for connections.
Version: '5.1.53'  socket: '/var/run/mysqld.sock'  port: 3306  Source distribution

then I ran
lighttpd -f /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf

then I look at /tmp/ and see this 
ls -al /tmp/php*
srwxr-xr-x    1 root     root             0 Jan 25 22:48 /tmp/php.socket-0
srwxr-xr-x    1 root     root             0 Jan 25 22:48 /tmp/php.socket-1
srwxr-xr-x    1 root     root             0 Jan 25 22:48 /tmp/php.socket-2
srwxr-xr-x    1 root     root             0 Jan 25 22:48 /tmp/php.socket-3

and I ran ps | grep php
 ps | grep php

 2214 root      5972 S    /usr/bin/php-cgi

 2219 root      5972 S    /usr/bin/php-cgi
 2220 root      5972 S    /usr/bin/php-cgi
