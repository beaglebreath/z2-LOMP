if i save the following as something like index.php and load it a browser

<?php
//phpinfo();
//echo $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];

$servername = "localhost";
$username = "";
$password = "";

// create connection
$conn = mysqli_connect($servername, "", "");

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>

then i get the following error

Warning: mysqli_connect() [function.mysqli-connect]: (HY000/2002): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp' (111) in /www/index.php on line 10
